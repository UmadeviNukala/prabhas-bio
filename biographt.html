  <p>
Prabhas, whose full name is Uppalapati Venkata Suryanarayana Prabhas Raju, is a renowned Indian actor predominantly known for his work in Telugu cinema. He made his debut with the film *Eeswar* in 2002, but it was the 2004 romantic action film *Varsham* that marked his first major success. He continued to build his career with commercial hits like *Chatrapathi* (2005), *Billa* (2009), *Darling* (2010), *Mr. Perfect* (2011), and *Mirchi* (2013), for which he received the prestigious Nandi Award for Best Actor. Prabhas achieved unprecedented fame with the role of Amarendra Baahubali and Mahendra Baahubali in S. S. Rajamouli’s *Baahubali* franchise. *Baahubali: The Beginning* (2015) and its sequel *Baahubali 2: The Conclusion* (2017) became monumental successes, with the latter becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of its time, earning over ₹1000 crore globally and transforming Prabhas into a pan-Indian superstar.

Following *Baahubali*, he starred in high-budget films like *Saaho* (2019), which showcased his action persona, and *Radhe Shyam* (2022), where he explored a romantic role. His 2023 release *Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire* emerged as the highest-grossing Telugu film of the year, further proving his box office strength. Prabhas is widely praised for his dedication, spending years on single projects and physically transforming himself for demanding roles. Internationally, he has a massive fan base, especially in countries like Japan and Russia. Currently, he is working on *Kalki 2898 AD*, a science fiction epic based on the Hindu mythology of Mahabharata, alongside upcoming projects like *The Raja Saab* and *Fauji*.
